 # DevOps Take Home

We have a simple REST application written in Java that we would like to deploy to an EKS cluster.  You have 24 hours
to complete this assignment.

# Assignment
Dockerize the application and create a helm chart for it.  Set up Pulumi to deploy the helm chart to an EKS cluster.  Set up Github action to perform the Pulumi deployment.

# Requirements
- The application should run as a pod on an EKS cluster.
- The application should be reachable from the internet.
- Application configuration updates should not require a rebuild of the application.
- Merges into the main branch should trigger a Pulumi deployment.

# Questions
If you have questions please send an email to takehome@grepr.ai

# Deliverables
- A PR containing the code to achieve the stated assignment. (Please fork this repository and submit a PR with your changes.)
- A plan generated by Pulumi. (Please post this plan as a comment on the PR)
